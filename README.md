# Mandelbrot Set Viewer

This project provides a simple and interactive visualization of the Mandelbrot set, utilizing WebGL for rendering. Users can zoom and pan to explore different parts of the Mandelbrot set and adjust the color settings to enhance the visual experience.

## Features

- **Zooming**: Mouse wheel/trackpad two-finger drag to zoom in and out.
- **Panning**: Click and drag to move around the set.
- **Color Adjustment**: Choose from preset color themes or customize the colors.
- **Resolution Adjustment**: Change the number of iterations for finer or coarser detail.

## Technology

The Mandelbrot Set Viewer is implemented using plain HTML and JavaScript with WebGL for efficient graphical computations and rendering.
